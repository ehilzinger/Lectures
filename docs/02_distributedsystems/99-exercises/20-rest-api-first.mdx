# Beginner's Guide to Building a REST API with Node.js

**Introduction**
Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide to creating your first REST API using Node.js! This tutorial will take you through the fundamental principles of REST, setting up your development environment, and building a simple API step by step. By the end of this guide, you will have a working REST API and an understanding of core RESTful concepts.

---

## **1. Understanding REST**

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs follow a set of principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficiency.

### **Key REST Principles:**

- **Statelessness:** Each request from a client must contain all the necessary information to process it.
- **Client-Server Architecture:** The client and server are separate entities communicating through HTTP.
- **Uniform Interface:** Consistent naming conventions and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Resource-Based:** Everything is treated as a resource, represented by a URL.

## **2. Setting Up Your Development Environment**

Before we begin coding, letâ€™s set up our environment step by step.

### **Step 1: Install Node.js**

Download and install the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). You can verify the installation by running:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

### **Step 2: Create a Project Directory**

Open your terminal and run:

```sh
mkdir my-rest-api
cd my-rest-api
```

### **Step 3: Initialize a Node.js Project**

Run the following command inside your project directory to create a `package.json` file:

```sh
npm init -y
```

This file will manage dependencies and project configurations.

### **Step 4: Install Express.js**

Express is a popular framework for building APIs with Node.js.

```sh
npm install express
```

## **3. Creating Your First REST API**

Now, let's write our first API.

### **Step 1: Create an `index.js` File**

Create a new file `index.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON requests

// Sample data
let books = [
  { id: 1, title: "The Great Gatsby", author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald" },
  { id: 2, title: "1984", author: "George Orwell" },
];

// GET all books
app.get("/books", (req, res) => {
  res.json(books);
});

// GET a single book by ID
app.get("/books/:id", (req, res) => {
  const book = books.find((b) => b.id == req.params.id);
  book ? res.json(book) : res.status(404).json({ message: "Book not found" });
});

// POST a new book
app.post("/books", (req, res) => {
  const newBook = { id: books.length + 1, ...req.body };
  books.push(newBook);
  res.status(201).json(newBook);
});

// DELETE a book
app.delete("/books/:id", (req, res) => {
  books = books.filter((b) => b.id != req.params.id);
  res.status(204).send();
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### **Step 2: Run the API**

Start your server with:

```sh
node index.js
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see:

```
Server running at http://localhost:3000
```

## **4. Testing Your API with Insomnia**

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) is a tool for testing API requests.

1. Download and install Insomnia.
2. Open Insomnia and create a new request.
3. **GET** `http://localhost:3000/books` - Retrieves all books.
4. **GET** `http://localhost:3000/books/1` - Retrieves a specific book.
5. **POST** `http://localhost:3000/books` - Adds a new book (Body: JSON format).
6. **DELETE** `http://localhost:3000/books/1` - Removes a book.

---

## **5. Exercises**

Try the following exercises to deepen your understanding. **No direct solutions are providedâ€”experiment and learn!**

### **Exercise 1: Add a New Endpoint**

Modify your API to allow users to **update** an existing book using a `PUT` request.

- The request should accept a book ID and update its title and/or author.
- Test the endpoint using Insomnia.

### **Exercise 2: Implement Error Handling**

Currently, our API does not handle errors effectively. Improve it by:

- Returning a 400 status if required fields are missing in a `POST` request.
- Returning a 404 status if a book ID does not exist in a `PUT` or `DELETE` request.

### **Exercise 3: Filter Books by Author**

Add support for query parameters, allowing users to retrieve books by a specific author using:

```
GET /books?author=George%20Orwell
```

## **6. Conclusion & Next Steps**

Congratulations! You've built your first REST API with Node.js and Express. Next steps:

- Learn about middleware and authentication.
- Explore databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
- Implement error handling and validation.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
