# Exercise: Introduction to Distributed Systems

**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Group Size:** 4 students per group

## **Objectives:**

- Understand the core concepts of distributed systems.
- Explore the CAP theorem, resilience, and consistency in distributed systems.
- Discuss real-world applications and deployments of distributed systems.
- Investigate distributed transactions and system reliability.

---

## **Part 1: Exploring the Basics (30 min)**

Each group will research and discuss the following topics:

1. **Definition and Characteristics of Distributed Systems**

   - What makes a system distributed?
   - Key properties: Scalability, Fault Tolerance, Concurrency, and Latency

2. **Layering in Distributed Systems**
   - Identify and describe key layers (e.g., application, transport, network)
3. **CAP Theorem**

   - Explain Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
   - Why canâ€™t a system achieve all three simultaneously?
   - Real-world implications of CAP theorem.

4. **Resilience and System Reliability**

   - How do distributed systems handle failures?
   - Strategies such as replication, failover, and load balancing.

5. **Deployments in Distributed Systems**

   - Centralized vs. decentralized vs. peer-to-peer architectures.
   - Cloud-based vs. on-premise deployments.

6. **Distributed Transactions and Consistency**
   - Understanding two-phase commit (2PC) and three-phase commit (3PC).
   - Eventual consistency vs. strong consistency in databases.

ðŸ’¡ **Task:** Each group summarizes their findings on a shared digital document (Google Docs, Miro Board, etc.).

---

## **Part 2: Exploring a Real-World Use Case (30 min)**

Each group will investigate a real-world distributed system, analyzing its design and challenges. Possible examples:

- Google Docs: How does it maintain consistency and availability?
- Blockchain: How does it ensure decentralization and resilience?
- Netflix Content Delivery Network (CDN): How does it handle distributed video streaming?
- Amazon DynamoDB: How does it implement eventual consistency?

ðŸ’¡ **Task:** Each group selects one system, researches its architecture, and identifies how it addresses CAP theorem constraints, resilience, consistency, and transactions.

---

## **Part 3: Reflection & Discussion (30 min)**

Each group presents their findings:

1. **Key Takeaways from Research** â€“ Summary of CAP theorem, resilience, deployments, and distributed transactions.
2. **Insights from the Real-World Case Study** â€“ Challenges faced and solutions implemented.
3. **Discussion Questions:**
   - How do different distributed systems balance consistency and availability?
   - What trade-offs do businesses face when deploying distributed architectures?
   - How would you design a distributed system for an online banking application?

---

## **Wrap-up & Submission**

- Each group submits their research summary and a short report on their findings from the real-world case study.
- One or more groups present and discuss their findings.
